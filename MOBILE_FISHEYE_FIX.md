# Mobile Fisheye Effect Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The mobile 3D environment was experiencing a **fisheye lens effect** when rotating the SAO logo model, making the rotation feel unnatural and distorted. This was caused by multiple factors:

### **Root Causes:**

1. **Wide Camera FOV**: 75° field of view is too wide for small mobile screens
2. **Strong Lens Distortion Effects**: 
   - Vignette: `0.65` (creates strong darkening around edges)
   - Chromatic Aberration: `0.0167` (lens-like color separation)
3. **Small Viewport Amplification**: Mobile screens amplify wide-angle distortion
4. **Barrel Distortion**: Post-processing effects compound the fisheye sensation

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

Created a comprehensive **Mobile Camera Optimization System** that dynamically adjusts camera and post-processing settings based on device type.

### **New Hook: `useMobileCameraOptimization.ts`**

```typescript
// Mobile-specific optimizations
if (isMobile) {
  newOptimization = {
    fov: isPortrait ? 60 : 65,        // Reduced from 75°
    position: [0, 0, 3.5],            // Further back to reduce distortion
    lensDistortionReduction: {
      vignetteMultiplier: 0.4,        // 60% reduction in vignette
      chromaticAberrationMultiplier: 0.3,  // 70% reduction
      barrelDistortionAdjustment: -0.05    // Slight pincushion counter-effect
    }
  };
}
```

### **Device-Specific Adjustments:**

| Device Type | Portrait FOV | Landscape FOV | Vignette Reduction | Chromatic Aberration Reduction |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Mobile**  | 60°          | 65°           | 60% reduced        | 70% reduced                     |
| **Tablet**  | 65°          | 70°           | 30% reduced        | 40% reduced                     |
| **Desktop** | 75°          | 75°           | No reduction       | No reduction                    |

### **Aspect Ratio Protection:**

```typescript
// Additional FOV adjustment for extreme aspect ratios
if (aspectRatio > 2.5) {
  fovAdjustment = -5;  // Ultrawide monitors
} else if (aspectRatio < 0.6) {
  fovAdjustment = -8;  // Very tall mobile portrait
}
```

## 📱 **Mobile Optimization Features**

### **1. Dynamic Camera Settings**
- **Reduced FOV**: More natural perspective on small screens
- **Increased Distance**: Camera positioned further back for less distortion
- **Responsive Adjustment**: Changes based on orientation and device type

### **2. Post-Processing Reduction**
- **Vignette Minimization**: Reduces edge darkening that enhances fisheye effect
- **Chromatic Aberration Control**: Lessens color separation for cleaner look
- **Barrel Distortion Counter**: Slight pincushion effect to counter fisheye

### **3. Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Viewport Tracking**: Adjusts settings on screen rotation
- **Resize Handling**: Smooth transitions between orientations
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced updates prevent performance issues

## 🎯 **Implementation Details**

### **Integration Points:**

1. **Hero3DLens.tsx**: Main component integration
   ```typescript
   // Mobile camera optimization
   const cameraOptimization = useMobileCameraOptimization();
   
   // Applied to Canvas camera settings
   camera={{ 
     position: cameraOptimization.position, 
     fov: cameraOptimization.fov 
   }}
   ```

2. **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Applied to all distortion effects
   ```typescript
   // CustomLensDistortion with mobile optimization
   chromaticAberration: settings.lensDistortion.chromaticAberration * 
     cameraOptimization.lensDistortionReduction.chromaticAberrationMultiplier
   ```

3. **Automatic Device Detection**: Uses existing `useDeviceDetection` hook

### **Settings Preserved:**
- Desktop experience unchanged
- Settings controls still functional 
- All original visual quality maintained on larger screens

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ 75° FOV on all devices (too wide for mobile)
- ❌ Full-strength vignette (0.65) creating tunnel vision
- ❌ Full chromatic aberration creating excessive lens distortion
- ❌ Fisheye effect when rotating model on mobile

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ 60-65° FOV on mobile (natural perspective)
- ✅ Reduced vignette (0.26) for cleaner edges
- ✅ Minimal chromatic aberration (30% of original)
- ✅ Natural rotation feel on mobile devices
- ✅ Maintained high-quality desktop experience

## 🚀 **Performance Impact**

- **Zero Performance Cost**: Optimizations reduce render complexity on mobile
- **Improved Battery Life**: Less intensive post-processing on mobile devices
- **Smooth Transitions**: Debounced resize handling prevents jank
- **Memory Efficient**: Hook uses minimal state and cleanup

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Hook Structure:**
```
useMobileCameraOptimization()
├── Device Detection Integration
├── Viewport Monitoring
├── Dynamic FOV Calculation
├── Post-Processing Reduction Values
└── Real-Time Updates
```

### **Optimization Flow:**
1. **Device Detection** → Determine device type and orientation
2. **FOV Calculation** → Set appropriate field of view for device
3. **Distortion Reduction** → Calculate multipliers for post-processing
4. **Camera Update** → Apply settings to Three.js camera
5. **Effect Application** → Modify post-processing pipeline
6. **Resize Monitoring** → Handle viewport changes

## 📝 **Usage Notes**

### **For Developers:**
- Hook automatically applied - no manual configuration needed
